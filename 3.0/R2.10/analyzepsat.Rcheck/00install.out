================================================================================ 

Welcome to UKFSST - A package for improving tracking of tagged
sea creatures by including Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
in the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based reconstruction model. 

What you typically want to do is the following sequence:

1) Read in a track(
2) Obtain a corresponding SST-field
3) Reconstruct the track
4) Investigate the fitted track by plots and summaries

A slightly more detailed description of these four steps
including what functions may be useful and how to call them is
available via the function 'road.map'. If needed simply type: 

   road.map()

and the text will be displayed.

Check also the complete example in the 'blue.shark' dataset
documentation by typing:

  example(blue.shark)

Thank you for your efforts in downloading and trying this
software. If you encounter any bugs or have any questions -
please don't hesitate to contact me:
