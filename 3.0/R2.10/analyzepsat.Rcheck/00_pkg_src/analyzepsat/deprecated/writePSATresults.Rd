\title{
Writes an Excel file of all estimated track results
}
\description{
Writes an Excel file of all estimated track results utilizing RODBC functionality
}
\usage{
writePSATresults(xtracks, file = "PSAT_output.xls", Temp = F, Depth = F, psat = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xtracks}{
List of all final estimated tracks. This must be a named list.
}
  \item{file}{
filename for output file. Once this is spcified it may not be specified again unless you erase the original.
}
  \item{Temp}{
Should temperature matrix be saved?
}
  \item{Depth}{
Should depth matrix be saved?
}
  \item{psat}{
If either Temp or Depth = T, this is the corresponding object created by MWT_extract4. Typically, this is a large list of objects corrsponding to a group of PSATs. This should be named exactly as the xtarcks object so that the appropriate Temperature/Depth is matched with the final estimated track.
