\title{
Generates a sample from a multivariate normal distribution
}
\description{
This is identical to a function found in the QRMlib library. I copied it here for ease of use without having another library to load.
}
\usage{
rmnorm2(n, Sigma = equicorr(d, rho), mu = rep(0, d), d = 2, rho = 0.7)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{
number of points to generate
}
  \item{Sigma}{
Covariance matrix
}
  \item{mu}{
mean of the distribution
}
  \item{d}{
number of columns for the output
}
  \item{rho}{
not used.... 
}
}
\details{

}
\value{
dataframe of two columns, in this case it will be longitudes and latitudes drawn from a bivariate normal distribution.
